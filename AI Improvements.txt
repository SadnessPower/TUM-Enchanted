GENERAL

- AI is faster now! Implemented an optimization mechanism which speeds up AI turn while maintaining the same quality.

- Configurable max AI Heroes for difficulty level (see Lang/AI.json).

- Removed global AI max hero limit according to difficulty level. Previously, AI will not hire new heroes if there are globally the following numbers of heroes: Easy=9, Normal=12, Hard=15, Expert=18, Impossible=21.

- Fixed a bug that prevents AI to build all buildings (even special ones) in their towns.

- Fixed bug (probably from original game) in which where an Hero visit a town of the following types: Tower, Inferno, Dungeon and Stronghold under certain conditions AI will always try to build special building 23 
(Wall of Knowledge, Order of Fire, Academy of Battle Scholars, Hall of Valhalla) even though it is already built, spending resources and town building turn. This will cause slowdowns in Town Building 
and even completely stopping making building in that town if the hero is stuck in the town or it is continuously visiting it. (Thanks to TheInvisible1966 for testing and creating conditions to reproduce that)

-------------------------
ADVENTURE AI IMPROVEMENTS

- Now AI will go straight capturing towns he think he can beat if they are reachable in current turn, no matter what. No more distraction along the way, no more ignoring capturable towns!

- AI will capture enemy towns even if there are stronger enemy heroes nearby, if he can safely run afterwards without being caught.

- AI heroes now have +2 scouting radius to match human players' one. Vanilla AI scouting radius doesn't let AI seeing enemy towns which a human player could.

- Increased AI thinking radius to 128000 for heroes which are not in explore mode. 

- Now AI will always use max thinking radius distance set by UN:J4. WOG implemention for that trigger was incomplete, leading to rarely using max thinking radius.

- Fixed vanilla AI behaviour sometimes leading to pass turn on heroes which still have movement points left (this occured a lot when entering monoliths, but not only that).

- Now AI will not pass turn with full movement points when he cannot find a path for escaping a danger zone (stronger enemy hero). In this case, danger zone will be gradually reduced and path calculation will be retried until a path is found.

- (Experimental) Now AI will defend his towns taking in consideration also adventure spells which can be cast by enemy (Fly, Dimension Door, Town Portal, Water Walk, etc)

- Treasure Chest choice - New logic has been implemented:
Heroes are sorted by level (1st is the highest), then strength

1st: XP until level 10, then gold
2nd/3nd: XP until level 10 if 1st has already reached lvl 10, gold otherwise
4-5-6-7-8th: XP until level 10 if 2nd & 3rd have already reached lvl 10, gold otherwise


-------------------------
BATTLE AI IMPROVEMENTS 
(apply to AUTO/QUICK COMBAT and for AI controlled players)

- Ballista will never shot to an enemy stacks with Blind, Paralyze or Petrification.
  If enemy has only stacks with the above debuff, Ballista will pass turn without shooting (Defend).

- Against neutral, AI will no more rush his stacks forward to attack the enemy, instead will defend his shooters or wait for enemy to come, letting the shooters do their job.
  No more Phoenixes/Dragon Flies/Wyverns rushing inside the enemy line only to be crushed!
  
  Trigger condition details: 
  - Only VS neutral stack 
  - AI has shooters and enemy hasn't
  - Each enemy stack cannot reach any of AI stacks in the next movement turn
  
  AI will starts attacking only when enemy could reach him in next turn.
  
  This behaviour is not applied to neutral stacks except during a siege.


- Now AI will never decide to gather his army near shooters to defend them if enemy can cast one on the following spells: Chain Lightning, Frost Ring, Fireball, Inferno, Meteor Shower or Berserk (with Expert skill only)

  This behaviour is not applied to neutral stacks except during a siege.


- AI creatures will no more cast buff/debuff on stacks already having the same buff/debuff.

- When defending against a siege, AI will evaluate more often to stay inside the castle to better defend himself (thanks to Raistlin).

- AI will not try anymore to chase enemy high speed stacks which are put near his slower stacks as a distraction (thanks to Ben80).

- Arrow Towers target logic is now much more complex, and smarter (thanks to Raistlin).

- Soul Eater Animate Dead ability cast requirement adjusted to match skill description (levels 1-5), instead of target stack HP.
-----------------
SPELLS

- ANTIMAGIC: 
   - Fixed AI evaluating using Antimagic for removing spells he cannot remove due to having too low Earth Magic level. This caused AI casting Antimagic for removing a debuff and actually not removing it. Now he will consider only spells he can successfully remove.

   - Fixed AI evaluation erroneously considering dispelling all spells instead of only bad ones (good spells are not removed by Antimagic).
   
   - Now AI will evaluate casting Antimagic to remove debuff instead of Dispel/Cure for protecting the stack from future casting of mind spells he has already seen. 
     Originally, AI were only evaluating casting Antimagic for damage reduction from spells. Now, when casting Antimagic for removing a spell, the Antimagic score will get a +33% bonus for protecting that creature from being targeted again in the future.

- CLONE usage increased: If current stack is the strongest, its Clone value is doubled (it will result in AI casting Clone more often on current stack if it's the strongest).

- CURE: Fixed Expert Cure not removing Hypnotize

- DISPEL/CURE/ANTIMAGIC: Now AI will evaluate using those spells for removing BLIND/STONE/PARALYZE.

- DISPEL: Fixed vanilla bug which prevented AI to calculate benefits for dispelling friendly units. Now AI will use dispel more often.

- HYPNOTIZE casting value now adds the Blind value to the Hypnotize value, since the creature will not be able to be controlled as well.  
It will result in AI casting or dispelling Hypnotize more often. 

- PROTECTION FROM FIRE/EARTH/AIR/WATER: Score is now divided by the number of useful spells enemy hero can cast. This will result in AI casting this spell much rarely.

- SUMMON FIRE/EARTH/AIR/WATER: If ACM is enabled, AI will evaluate it by using ACM summoning calculation
