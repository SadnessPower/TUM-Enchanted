## LATEST CHANGELOG
Now TUM Enchanted will feature AI Improvements! Cheats are not welcomed, the AI behaviour will be smarter.
For a complete and detailed list of all AI improvements refer to [AI Improvements.txt](https://github.com/SadnessPower/TUM-Enchanted/blob/main/AI%20Improvements.txt)  

### AI RELATED CHANGES:

**BATTLE AI IMPROVEMENTS**   
(applies to AUTO/QUICK COMBAT and for AI controlled players)  
  
- Against neutral, AI will no more rushes his stacks forward to attack the enemy, instead will defend his shooters or wait for enemy to come, letting the shooters do their job.  
No more Phoenixes/Dragon Flies/Wyverns rushing inside the enemy lines only to be crushed!  
- Now AI will never decide to gather his army near shooters to defend them if enemy can cast area of effect damage spells.  
- When defending against a siege, AI will evaluate more often to stay inside the castle to better defend himself (thanks to Raistlin).  
- AI will not try anymore to chase enemy high speed stacks which are put near his slower stacks as a distraction (thanks to Ben80).  
- Arrow Towers target logic is now much more complex and smarter (thanks to Raistlin).  
  
**AI TOWN BUILD BEHAVIOUR**  
The build logic for TUM building has been totally rewritten to work smoothly with the original system and is now calculated in the same way as the other HOMM3 buildings.  
It was deeply and fully tested for months, and is now officially stable.  
As a result of this, the following bugs were fixed:  
- Fixed AI not building required Mage Guild levels and/or prerequisite buildings needed for dwelling upgrades.  
- Fixed nasty bug which causes sometimes the AI not building structures anymore for the rest of the game when he owns more than one incompleted (=not all building are built) town.  
- Fixed nasty bug which causes sometimes the AI not building dwelling upgrades structures.  
...and also:  
- Fixed bug (probably from original game) which prevented AI to make some special buildings, and also wasting resources and town building turn. For details, see [AI Improvements.txt](https://github.com/SadnessPower/TUM-Enchanted/blob/main/AI%20Improvements.txt)  
  
**OTHERS**  
- Removed global AI max hero limit according to difficulty level (Easy=9, Normal=12, Hard=15, Expert=18, Impossible=21).  
- Fixed Expert CURE not removing Hypnotize spell.  
- Added "Remove theoretical battle AI vs AI" plugin. Now AI will play all battles like a human player.  
- Increased AI thinking radius to 128000.  
---------------  
**IMPROVEMENTS**  
- Added support for Military Duty WOG option (thanks to TheInvisible1966 and Archer).  
- Strike and Return: now Holy Champion and Nomad can switch between Strike and Return / Strike and Stay attacks (thanks to Archer).  
  
**BUG FIXES:**  
- Fixed multiplayer crash during siege caused by Catapult losing all flags.  
- Fixed Hierophant commander causing game freeze when shooting.  
- Fixed Amethyst crash when using Quick Combat against an hero which has an Ammo Cart.  
- Fixed Stunning Attack (Gnoll and Troll skill) not working.  
- Fixed Dragon of the Abyss (TUM Black Dragon) being able to switch between Strike and Return / Strike and Stay attacks, even though Strike and Return has been removed in TUM Enchanted.  
  
**GRAPHIC IMPROVEMENTS**  
- Plague Zombie now have according small/large portrait (thanks to Dalion).  
- New skins and portraits for High Priest, Hell Stallion and Nightmare.   
- Reverted Ghost Dragon graphics to the original one.
