Now TUM Enchanted will feature AI Improvements! Cheats are not welcomed, the AI behaviour will be smarter.  
For a complete and detailed list of all AI improvements refer to [AI Improvements.txt](https://github.com/SadnessPower/TUM-Enchanted/blob/main/AI%20Improvements.txt)    

## LATEST CHANGELOGS 
2.5.3:  
**BUG FIXES**  
- Fixed regression causing left click on Capitol shows dialog for upgrading to a building not present in TUM Enchanted.  
- Fixed typo in WoG Option "Allow Building Twice per Day in Towns" causing it mistakenly disabling after start of each week.  
  
2.5.2:  
**IMPROVEMENTS**  
- Now all objects will be generated on random maps! (Previously some objects were never generated, like Emerald Tower, Battle Academy and many others).  
- Creature skills which put debuff on enemy stack now have those hard limits:  
  - Attack and Defense: No lower than 0.  
  - Min-Max Damage: No lower than 1.  
  - Speed: No lower than 3.  
  
**BUG FIXES**  
- Fixed WoG Option "Allow Building Twice per Day in Towns" not working after loading a game.  

2.5.1:  
Fixed the following regressions:  
- Left click on Castle icon will now propose TUM creatures if present.  
- Left click on small portraits in town screen now shows TUM creatures if present.  
- WoG Option "Allow Building Twice per Day in Towns" now works correctly on first turn for all players.   
  
2.5:  
**BATTLE AI IMPROVEMENTS**  
- ANTIMAGIC: Fixed AI AntiMagic evaluation erroneously considering dispelling all spells instead of only bad ones (good spells are not removed by Antimagic).  
- ANTIMAGIC: Now AI will evaluate casting Antimagic to remove debuff instead of Dispel/Cure for protecting the stack from future casting of mind spells he has already seen.   
  
**BUG FIXES**  
- Fixed rare bug when left clicking on bottom left creatures in town (Thanks to Trebuchet).  
  
**BALANCE**  
- The following creature skills cannot reduce enemy speed lower than 3:  
  - Crippling Attack (Centaur Warlord)  
  - Crippling Shoot (Marksman)  
  - Incapacitating Shoot (Crossbowman)  
  
**GRAPHICS**  
- Fix wrong Imperial Griffin Attack sound attack.  
- Pit Master, Darkness Dragon, Lord of the Swamp and Hell Baron now have new defs and portraits.  
 Portraits and graphics inconsistencies are now fixed.
